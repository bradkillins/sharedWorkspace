# sharedWorkspace

My first attempt at creating a web app. Built mainly with basic JavaScript. Uses localStorage as data storage.

A web-app that lets work-space renters connect with work-space owners.

Final Project: Phase 1
Using localStorage and sessionStorage to store object arrays locally on client.

There are two user types:

Owners

- Can view their own properties/workspaces
- Can create new properties/workspaces
- Can edit or delete their own properties/workspaces

Coworkers

- Can view a table of available workspaces that are marked listed.
- Can sort or filter by any column in the table.
- Can view owner details for any workspace in table.
